- SQL injection info disclosure by info leakage

	- injection point allowed you control ordering
	- you can do a true/false comparison to leak info about the db
	- 'case when ((SELECT substr(flag, 1, {}) FROM " + flag + " limi 1)='{}') then id else name end'
	- check if char in db name/flag is equal to x character, if true order by id else order by name


- Use sagemath for crypto problems

- Review eliptic curves, details of RSA. Do cryptohack

- elgamal signature scheme

- quiqiup and index of coincidence for solving cryptograms
